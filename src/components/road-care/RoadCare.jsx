                If you’ve pre-booked your rental car online, you’re in for an ultra-smooth ride. Just check in at our reception, review and sign your rental 
                agreement, and inspect the vehicle before hitting the road. It’s quick, efficient, and designed to get you behind the wheel in no time.
                For walk-in bookings, the process is just as straightforward, but might take a bit longer during busy periods like weekends and holidays. 
                Upon arrival at our Mangere car rental depot, simply approach our friendly staff at the front desk. We’ll verify your documents, help you choose a 
                vehicle from our available options, and guide you through the agreement before handing over the keys.
